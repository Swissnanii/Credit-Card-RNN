# Classification Project: Credit Card Classification

## What is the objective of this project?
The project aims to build a predictive model to identify whether a client is likely
to default on thir payment

## Where is the data from?
The dataset in this project is from the UCI repository link [UCI]https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/350/default+of+credit+card+clients. The dataset, Is collected from custoimers in Taiwan 

## Model Performance
The two models made were GRU and LSTM
- GRU:
  1) Precision:Macro Avg: 0.69% Weighted Avg: 0.79%
  2) Recall:Macro Avg: 0.69% Weighted Avg: 0.79%
 
  3)
